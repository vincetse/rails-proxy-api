# Proxy API

In 2019, I managed a team that used ActiveResource it a Ruby-on-Rails application.  Out of curiosity, I built this service as a mental exercise to learn about ActiveResource (which I believe to be on a deprecation path).  In 2026, I updated the dependencies and added CI as a refresher for myself.
